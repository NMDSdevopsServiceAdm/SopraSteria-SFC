    DHSC want to know how many workers will be protected from flu this winter. This information could tell us that 60%
    of care workers in a certain area are vaccinated. This will help identify any extra local demands on the NHS and the
    care sector. It could also highlight a need for better promotion of the vaccine within the care sector. Your data
    will not be shared with any other organisation.
