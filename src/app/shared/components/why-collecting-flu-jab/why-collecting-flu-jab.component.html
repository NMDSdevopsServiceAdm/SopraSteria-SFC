  <p>
    DHSC want to know how many workers will be protected from flu this winter.
    This information could tell us that 60% of care workers in a certain area are
    vaccinated. This will help identify any extra local demands on the NHS and
    the care sector. It could also highlight a need for better promotion of the
    vaccine within the care sector. Your data will not be shared with any other
    organisation.
