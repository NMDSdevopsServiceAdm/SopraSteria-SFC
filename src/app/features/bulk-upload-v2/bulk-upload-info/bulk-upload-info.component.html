  Bulk uploads let you add large amounts of workforce data into the Adult Social Care Workforce Data Set (ASC-WDS)
  without the need to add that data manually.
</p>
<h2>Who should do bulk uploads?</h2>
<p>
  Skills for Care recommend bulk uploads for local authorities and large private or voluntary sector employers who need
  to add data for a number of workplaces.
</p>
<p>
  Individual workplaces can also choose to bulk upload, but our findings suggest those with fewer than 50 staff records
  usually add their data manually.
</p>
<h2>What you need to know about bulk uploads</h2>
<p>
  You can only bulk upload CSV (comma-separated values) files. Previous experience of working with CSV files is helpful,
  but not necessary.
</p>
<p>Before you do your bulk upload, make sure you have unique references for each workplace and each staff record.</p>
<p class="govuk-inset-text">References are used by ASC-WDS to match staff records to a workplace.</p>
<p>
  After checking your references, download your current data into each file type you want to upload (staff, workplace
  and training) and update the records in those files if necessary.
</p>
<p>You always need to upload a staff file with a workplace file, but the training file is optional.</p>
