          Bulk upload lets you add large amounts of workforce data in the Adult Social Care Workforce Data Set, without
          the need to add that data manually.
        </p>
        <p>
          Skills for Care recommend bulk uploads for local authorities and large private or voluntary employers who need
          to add data for subsidiary workplaces.
        </p>
        <p>Individual workplaces with fewer than 50 staff members often find it easier to add their data manually.</p>
