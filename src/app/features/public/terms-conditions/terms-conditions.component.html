                where a data subject makes a written request to either party for access to any personal data, it is
                acknowledged that the Employer will be responsible for responding to any such request. SfC will notify
                the Employer as soon as reasonably possible following a request if it receives one directly to ensure
                the request is addressed in accordance with the Employer&apos;s obligations under the Data Protection

            If there is a personal data breach or any action that causes or could reasonably be deemed to cause a
            personal data breach, to the extent that such personal data breach is likely to impact the personal data
            processed by the other party, that party shall, at the earliest opportunity, notify the other party of the
            personal data breach and shall liaise and collaborate in order to meet their legal obligations to report a
            personal data breach in accordance with the Data Protection Legislation.

            time. SfC&apos;s privacy notice for workers can be found at

            of SfC&apos;s privacy notice for workers does not mean the Employer should not provide its own privacy
            notice to any individual in respect of collection of data for the Employer&apos;s own purposes.
