    <p>We would like to share your data with other organisations.</p>

    <app-details [title]="'Why do we share your data?'">
      <p>
        The Care Quality Commission use the data you provide as part of their overall suite of intelligence about adult
        social care providers and the wider sector. Local authorities use it to check compliance if the data for this
        service has been included as part of the criteria for a contract. Sharing your data with local authorities also
        makes them aware of your business. It allows them to discuss things like training events, advice and guidance
        with you.
