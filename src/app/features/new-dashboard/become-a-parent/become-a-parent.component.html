        <h2>What's a parent workplace?</h2>

        <p>
          A parent workplace is a workplace that’s taken responsibility in ASC-WDS for a number of other workplaces as
          part of a group or organisation.
        </p>
        <app-details data-testid="becomeAParentRevealTitle" [title]="'Why you might want to be a parent workplace'"
          ><p data-testid="becomeAParentRevealText">
            Parent workplaces can be given edit or view permissions for another workplace’s data in ASC-WDS.
            Alternatively, they can just be linked to, to show that they’re part of a group or organisation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Being a parent workplace can help to free up resources. Other workplace managers can then concentrate on
            tasks away from ASC-WDS, while the parent ensures that their workplaces' data meets Workforce Development
            Fund requirements.
