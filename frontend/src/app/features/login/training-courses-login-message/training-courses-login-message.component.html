      <span class="govuk-!-font-weight-bold">We've added NEW functionality</span> that lets you create a list of training courses that people in your workplace do.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-!-padding-top-1">
      Then, when you add a training record, you can select a course and the details of that course will be automatically populated for you (for example, the training course name and expiry date).
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-!-padding-top-1">This will save you time and make your training records more accurate.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">To add a training course to the list:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
      <li>Go to <a [routerLink]="['/dashboard']" [fragment]="'training-and-qualifications'" href="#" class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state">training and qualifications</a>.</li>
      <li>Click the 'Add and manage training' button.</li>
      <li>Select the 'Add and manage training courses' option.</li>
      <li>Click the 'Add a training course' button and add the course details.</li>
