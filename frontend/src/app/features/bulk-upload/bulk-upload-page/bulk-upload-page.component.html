      <p>
        Bulk uploads let you add large amounts of workforce data into the Adult Social Care Workforce Data Set, without
        the need to add that data manually.
      </p>
      <p>
        Skills for Care recommend bulk uploads for local authorities and large private or voluntary employers who need
        to add data for subsidiary workplaces.
      </p>
      <p>Individual workplaces with fewer than 50 staff members often find it easier to add their data manually.</p>
    </app-details>

    <p><b>Download your current data</b> and update the records in those CSV files before you do the bulk upload.</p>
    <p>You can <b>download codes and guidance</b> to use as references for how to update the records in your files.</p>
