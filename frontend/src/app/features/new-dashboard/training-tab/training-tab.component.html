            <p>
              This training and qualifications section allows you to add, store, view and keep track of your staff
              training.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can set specific training as mandatory for each job role you have, so you'll know when a staff member
              is missing that training. You will also get alerts when training has expired or is about to expire (you
              can even choose how far in advance to be alerted, so that you can plan in a way that suits your
              organisation).
            </p>
            <p>
              If a group of staff have attended a training course together, the 'Add training for multiple staff' option
              lets you update all their records in one go.
            </p>
            <p>
              Training and qualification records can be viewed for individual staff members or grouped together by
              training type. This makes it ideal for one-to-one reviews and for planning learning and development across
              the whole team. Records and summaries can be downloaded as reports to use offline, share with colleagues
              or collected as evidence for inspections.
