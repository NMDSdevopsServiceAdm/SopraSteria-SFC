    <p>
      The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) want to use our anonymised data to help them better understand the
      difficulties and cost of recruiting staff and keeping them working in the adult social care sector.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your information will help DHSC to identify where policy changes could make staff recruitment easier in the
      future.
